    "Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that incorporates L1 regularization to the cost function. L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model coefficients. This penalty term forces the model to select only the most important features while shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero, effectively performing feature selection and regularization simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, Lasso Regression has several distinct advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: Lasso Regression can be used to automatically select the most important features and discard irrelevant or redundant features, leading to a more parsimonious and interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Lasso Regression can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model by reducing the variance of the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity: Lasso Regression often results in sparse coefficient vectors, where many of the coefficients are exactly zero, which can simplify the model and make it more efficient to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: Lasso Regression is robust to outliers and can effectively handle datasets with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Lasso Regression also has some limitations and considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Biased estimates: Lasso Regression tends to bias the estimates of the coefficients towards zero, which can lead to an underestimation of the true effects of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the regularization parameter: The performance of Lasso Regression depends on the choice of the regularization parameter, which controls the strength of the penalty term. Choosing the right value for this parameter requires cross-validation or other tuning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity: Lasso Regression can struggle with multicollinearity, where two or more features are highly correlated with each other. In this case, it may be preferable to use other types of regularization, such as Ridge Regression or Elastic Net Regression, that combine L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Lasso Regression is a powerful and flexible regression technique that can be used to perform feature selection, regularization, and outlier detection in linear models. However, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs and limitations of this technique and to choose the appropriate regularization method based on the specific problem and the properties of the data.\n"

    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can automatically identify and select only the most important features, while setting the coefficients of the less important features to zero.\n",

    "Compared to other feature selection methods, such as forward or backward selection, Lasso Regression has the advantage of being able to consider all the features at once and automatically identify the most relevant ones, without the need for manual tuning or expert knowledge. \n",

    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be interpreted similarly to those of a standard linear regression model, with some additional considerations due to the L1 regularization penalty.\n",

    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, often denoted by λ (lambda). This parameter controls the strength of the L1 regularization penalty, which determines the degree of sparsity in the coefficient vector.\n",

    "A higher value of λ will increase the strength of the penalty term, resulting in more coefficients being set to zero and a sparser model. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model on new data, but may also lead to underfitting if too many important features are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a lower value of λ will reduce the strength of the penalty term, allowing more coefficients to remain non-zero and potentially resulting in a more complex model with better training performance but worse generalization performance.\n",

The L1 regularization penalty is still applied to promote sparsity in the coefficient vector and perform feature selection.\n",
